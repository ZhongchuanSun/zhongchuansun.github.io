About
---

I am a PhD candidate supervised by [Prof. Yangdong Ye](
http://www5.zzu.edu.cn/mlis/) at the School of Computer and Artificial Intelligence of Zhengzhou University, China.
My research focuses on developing novel machine learning and deep learning methods for recommender systems, which aim to provide personalized and intelligent services for users based on their preferences and behaviors.
I have published several papers in top journals including IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, IEEE Transaction on Industrial Informatics, Information Sciences, and SCIENTIA SINICA Informationis (in Chinese).

<!-- I am very passionate about my research and eager to learn new knowledge and skills. I hope to make original contributions to the field of recommender systems and artificial intelligence. I also enjoy collaborating with other researchers and practitioners from different backgrounds and domains. I am looking for opportunities to exchange ideas, share experiences and explore potential collaborations with peers around the world. -->
